The first prototype will be written in python.

Python provides a good language for the user's to write there AI's
because Python is a very forgiving language. In addition, there are
many graph theory libraries available that will make designing the map
a lot easier. 

The plan is to quickly develop a prototype in python and then to iterate
from there.

We will create an abstraction of the game by splitting up the map, cheese
, cat and mice into separate objects that interact with each other.

From here, the first step for us is to decide on the data structures to
be used for the map.

Ideas for the map so far:
    - the map will be cell-based, where each cell contains either a wall,
      floor tile, cat, cheese, mouse, etc.
    - Random map generation in a controlled manner.
    - The map should be connected (there exists a path from a to b for all
      points a,b on the map)
    - The map should minimize bridges?
    - Open spaces in the map may be used to make the game more difficult
      as it will be easier for the cat to manoeuvre.

Ideas for implementing the map included vertex lists and an adjacency matrix

Ideas for implementing the cat/cheese still need to be discussed.

Fog of War was considered as a feature, but it is not a high priority item.


THINGS TO DO:

0. Set out some specifications that we must adhere to.

1. Decide on data structures for our objects

2. Design the Topology (mice/cheese/cat/map layout)

3. Event scheduling (Computer/Player AI movement, cheese generation etc.)

4. Divide and Conquer (who is responsible for what?)

5. Code!!!



This file will be updated as more decisions about the design are made.
